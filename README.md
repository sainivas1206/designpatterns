### The Strategy Pattern
`Design Principle`
Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

`Design Principle`
Program to an interface, not an implementation

`Design Principle`
Favor composition over inheritance.

`The Strategy Pattern` defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### The Observer Pattern
`Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern`

`Design Principle`
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

`The Observer Pattern` defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### The Decorator Pattern`
`Design Principle`
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

`The Decorator Pattern` attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
